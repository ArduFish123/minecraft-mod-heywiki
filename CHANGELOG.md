# v1.5.4+1.21

## Changes

- If a wiki family is not found, an error message will be displayed instead of using Minecraft Wiki as fallback

## Fixes

- No longer crashes when Hey Wiki, Zoomify and RRLS are installed together (#57)
    - Note that this is a workaround and the root cause is still unknown
- No longer display the loading description placeholder when fetching the description fails
- Tooltip for open wiki key bind in the config menu is now correct
