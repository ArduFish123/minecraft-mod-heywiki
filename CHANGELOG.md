# v1.3.0

## Changes

- Now supports other wikis than Minecraft Wiki.
- [Experimental] Added JSON config for wiki support at `wiki_family/*.json` in resource packs.
  Please note that the JSON schema is not stable and is not semantically versioned yet.
  We very well might break it in minor versions.
- Added integration for Roughly Enough Items (REI).
- Added integration for EMI.
